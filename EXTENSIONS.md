# What is in the FrankenPHP images

The complete list of PHP extensions and tools in the `morsalin1342/frankenphp` images. The versions below were read from the **PHP 8.5.11 build on Debian 13 (trixie), 2026-10-10**; other PHP versions are built from the same list, and their extension versions differ. To see what any image has, run:

```bash
docker run --rm morsalin1342/frankenphp:8.5-trixie php -m          # loaded extensions
docker run --rm morsalin1342/frankenphp:8.5-trixie php --ri redis  # one extension's details
```

**86 extensions are loaded** by default: 35 compiled into PHP (core) and 51 installed on top (each has an `.ini` file in `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/`).

Each one is enabled by a file named `docker-php-ext-<name>.ini` or `xx-php-ext-<name>.ini` in `/usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/`.

### Turning an installed extension off

Remove its `.ini` file in your own image (`RUN rm /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/docker-php-ext-<name>.ini`), or build a filtered copy of the directory at start and point PHP at it:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/php-conf.d && cp /usr/local/etc/php/conf.d/*.ini /tmp/php-conf.d/
rm /tmp/php-conf.d/docker-php-ext-<name>.ini
export PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR=/tmp/php-conf.d
```

Fewer loaded extensions means less memory per process and a faster start. Measured on the PHP 8.5 image: all of them 60 MB and 140 ms for `php -r 1;`, a set of 16 common ones 39 MB and 73 ms (command-line process, resident memory, so shared pages are included).

## Not included on purpose

These are absent from the images; add them in your own image if you need them.

| Removed | Reason / alternative |
|---|---|
| `supervisor`, `cron` | Run workers and schedulers as separate containers from the same image with their own command. |
| `pcov` | A code-coverage tool for tests; not thread-safe under FrankenPHP (a segmentation fault in classic mode, listed as unsupported upstream). Collect coverage with a CI image. |
| `grpc`, `protobuf` | Large and slow to compile. Install with `install-php-extensions grpc protobuf`. |
| `rdkafka`, `amqp` | Message-queue clients. Install with `install-php-extensions rdkafka amqp`. |

## Known issues

- **`timezonedb` and `http` (with `raphf`) crash a configuration reload.** FrankenPHP restarts PHP's module state inside the same process when Caddy reloads its configuration (`frankenphp reload`, the admin API, `caddy reload`). On FrankenPHP 1.13.0 with PHP 8.5.11, `timezonedb` segfaults on the second reload (in `zend_register_ini_entries_ex`) and `http` double-frees in `php_persistent_handle_hash_dtor` (`raphf/src/php_raphf_api.c:307`). The same crash reproduces on the stock `dunglas/frankenphp` image with only that extension added. **If you reload the configuration, do not load these two** (see *Turning an installed extension off*). They are not on FrankenPHP's own [known-issues list](https://frankenphp.dev/docs/known-issues/).
- **`imagick` and OpenMP threads.** ImageMagick's OpenMP threads can conflict with FrankenPHP's threads. In this image the Imagick thread limit is already 1 and `imagick.set_single_thread` is on, which is the mitigation FrankenPHP documents.
- **`.user.ini` was not read** by FrankenPHP in our tests (FrankenPHP 1.12.7; not retested on 1.13.0). Set PHP options with `php_ini` lines in the Caddyfile or `.ini` files in `conf.d`.
- **A request or two can fail at the instant of a configuration reload** (a 500 was seen on 2 to 3 of about 80 requests during reloads, on this image and on the stock one).
- This is the thread-safe (ZTS) build of PHP, which FrankenPHP requires; every extension must be thread-safe.

## Tools

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PHP | 8.5.11 (ZTS) | The tag selects the version: 8.2, 8.3, 8.4 or 8.5. |
| Composer | 2.10.3 |  |
| WP-CLI | 2.12.0 | A pinned release, checked against its published SHA-256 at build time (`WP_CLI_VERSION`, `WP_CLI_SHA256`). |
| Node.js / npm | 24.21.0 / 11.19.0 | Major version set by the `NODE_VERSION` build argument (default 24). |
| MariaDB client | 12.3.3 | From MariaDB's own apt repository (series set by `MARIADB_SERIES`; the repository key is checked against a pinned fingerprint). The `mysql`, `mysqldump`, `mysqlcheck`, `mysqladmin`, `mysqlimport` and `mysqlshow` commands are small wrappers for the `mariadb*` tools, which run under their own names so that no "Deprecated program name" notice is printed. There is no MySQL client. |
| ImageMagick | 7.1.1-43 |  |
| ffmpeg | 7.1.5 |  |
| msmtp / msmtp-mta | 1.8.28 | Provide your SMTP relay in `/etc/msmtprc`; see the comment in the Dockerfile for how `mail()` is wired. |
| gosu | 1.17 | Drops privileges from an entrypoint. |
| acl (`setfacl`, `getfacl`) | 2.3.2 | POSIX ACLs. |
| git, curl, wget, jq, zip, unzip, less, procps, netcat-openbsd, dnsutils, libcap2-bin, libnss3-tools | Debian 13 packages |  |

## FrankenPHP and Caddy

| Component | Version |
|---|---|
| FrankenPHP | 1.13.0 |
| Caddy | 2.11.7 |

The `frankenphp` binary is a custom build made with `xcaddy` (Go build tags `nobadger,nomysql,nopgx,nomercure`; the Mercure hub is left out). It keeps the file capability `cap_net_bind_service=ep`, so a container that drops all capabilities must add `NET_BIND_SERVICE` back. These Caddy modules are compiled in, each pinned to an explicit version in the Dockerfile:

| Module | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `http.handlers.waf` (Coraza) | 2.6.2 | Web application firewall |
| `http.handlers.cache` and `admin.api.souin` (Souin) | 1.7.9 | HTTP cache |
| `storages.cache.redis`, `.otter`, `.simplefs` | 0.0.20 | Souin storage back ends |
| `http.handlers.defender` | 0.10.1 | IP and range blocking |
| `http.handlers.rate_limit` | 0.1.0 | Rate limiting |
| `http.encoders.br` (cbrotli) | 1.0.1 | Brotli responses |
| `dns.providers.azure` | 0.6.0 | DNS-01 ACME challenges |
| `dns.providers.cloudflare` | 0.2.4 | DNS-01 ACME challenges |
| `dns.providers.digitalocean` | 0.0.0-20250606074528 | DNS-01 ACME challenges |
| `dns.providers.googleclouddns` | 1.1.0 | DNS-01 ACME challenges |
| `dns.providers.route53` | 1.6.2 | DNS-01 ACME challenges |
| `dns.providers.vultr` | 0.0.0-20250723121531 | DNS-01 ACME challenges |

List them in any image with `frankenphp list-modules --versions`.

| `MARIADB_KEY_FPR` | pinned | Expected fingerprint of MariaDB's release signing key |
